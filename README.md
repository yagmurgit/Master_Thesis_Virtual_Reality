# Transfer of Spatial Knowledge from an Immersive Virtual to a Real World: A Comparative Evaluation

This repository contains the Unity project and analysis scripts for my Masterâ€™s thesis. The project includes two scenes: one for single-floor conditions and another for multi-floor conditions.

In this thesis, various statistical methods were employed to address specific research questions. The analysis scripts can be found in the "Statistical Methods" folder. All data used in this analysis is available at: https://osf.io/nf3rm/

To measure the main effects of both Learning Environment and Complexity, a Mixed ANOVA design was utilized. The Mann-Whitney U Test was employed to assess differences in performance for each object individually. when comparing the distance traveled and the number of boxes picked, the Mann-Whitney U Test was used for the single-floor condition, while a T-Test was applied for the multi-floor environment. Additionally, linear regression was used to examine the relationship between the number of errors and both the number of boxes picked and the total distance covered.

For each analysis, normality tests, homogeneity tests, and the results of the statistical methods are included in the code.
